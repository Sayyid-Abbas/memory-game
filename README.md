# Flip Card Memory Game

A simple frontend project using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** â€” built entirely by me.

---

## Project Description

In this game, the player must match pairs of identical cards by flipping them two at a time.

- The cards are shuffled randomly at the start.
- Each correct match keeps the cards flipped.
- Each wrong match flips the cards back after a short delay.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched.

The final screen includes two buttons:

- **Try Again**
- **Close Game**
